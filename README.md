# GIS-Project: Population dynamics in Saxon municipalities

This project aims to explain a share of the depopulation dynamics in Saxony using spatial data analysis.

**Preparations**\
In order to function properly, the following preparations should be done:\
- create a \data\raw folder structure\
- download SEDAC population raster data for the years 2015 and 2020 in resolution 30ms\
- download Saxon municipality shape files from GeoSN: <https://www.geodaten.sachsen.de/downloadbereich-verwaltungsgrenzen-4344.html>\
- include these in the \data\raw folder
